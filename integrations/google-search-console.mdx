The Google Search Console integration imports search query and landing page data into Superlines, giving you a fuller picture of how users discover your brand across both traditional and AI-powered search.

## What you get

- **Search query performance** — see which queries drive impressions and clicks to your site

- **Search intent signals** — compare traditional search queries with the AI prompts your brand appears in
