description: Import real user search queries and automatically discover relevant prompts to track in AI search.
---

The Google Search Console integration imports real search queries from GSC into Superlines and uses them to automatically identify relevant prompts for AI search monitoring.

## What you get

- **Automatic prompt discovery** — Superlines analyzes your GSC queries and identifies which ones are relevant to track as AI prompts
- **Real user queries as prompts** — import actual search terms people use to find your site and monitor them across AI engines
- **Query-to-prompt mapping** — understand which traditional search queries also appear as AI prompts
