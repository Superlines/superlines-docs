The Google Analytics integration connects GA4 to Superlines so you can detect and measure traffic coming from LLMs and AI-powered search.

## What you get

- **LLM traffic detection** — identify website visits referred by AI assistants like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Perplexity
- **AI vs organic comparison** — see how AI-referred traffic compares to traditional organic search
- **Engagement from AI referrals** — measure how visitors from AI sources interact with your site
