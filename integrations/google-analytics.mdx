The Google Analytics integration brings GA4 metrics into Superlines so you can correlate AI search visibility with real website performance.

## What you get

- **AI traffic vs organic** — compare traffic from AI-powered referrals against traditional organic search

- **Conversion correlation** — understand how share of voice in AI search relates to real business outcomes
