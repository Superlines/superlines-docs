The Site Analyzer performs a full technical SEO audit on any URL, checking for issues across security, indexability, meta tags, content, links, performance, mobile readiness, and structured data. It provides a health score and prioritized recommendations to fix the most impactful issues first.

## How to use it

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter a URL">
    Navigate to **Site Analyzer** in the Tools section. Enter the URL you want to audit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the audit">
    Click **Run Audit**. The tool crawls the page and evaluates it across all categories. This takes 15–60 seconds depending on page complexity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the health score">
    The overall health score (0–100) appears at the top, along with counts of critical issues, warnings, notices, and passed checks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Work through recommendations">
    The Priority Fixes section lists the most impactful issues to address. Expand each category in the detailed analysis for the full picture.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Health score

The overall score reflects the technical health of the page:

| Score | Rating | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 80–100 | Excellent | Few or no issues found |
| 60–79 | Good | Some issues to address but fundamentally sound |
| 40–59 | Needs Improvement | Significant issues that could affect AI visibility |
| 0–39 | Poor | Critical issues requiring immediate attention |

## Issues summary

Four cards at the top provide a quick overview:

| Card | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Critical Issues** | Problems that must be fixed — blocking indexing or AI discovery |
| **Warnings** | Important issues that degrade performance or visibility |
| **Notices** | Minor suggestions for improvement |
| **Passed** | Checks that passed successfully |

Click any card to filter the detailed analysis to show only that severity level.

## Page information

A summary card shows key page metadata:

- URL and page title
- HTTPS status
- Word count
- H1 tag count
- Image count (total and with alt text)
- Internal and external link counts

## Detailed analysis by category

Issues are organized into categories, each expandable:

| Category | What it checks |
|---|---|
| **Security** | HTTPS, mixed content, security headers |
| **Indexability** | Robots meta, canonical tags, sitemap presence |
| **Meta Tags** | Title, description, Open Graph, social tags |
| **Content** | Word count, heading structure, readability, duplicate content |
| **Links** | Broken links, redirect chains, anchor text quality |
| **Performance** | Page speed indicators, resource optimization |
| **Mobile** | Mobile responsiveness, viewport configuration |
| **Structured Data** | Schema.org markup, JSON-LD validation |

Each issue within a category includes:

- **Type** — critical, warning, notice, or passed
- **Title** — what the issue is
- **Description** — why it matters
- **Affected elements** — how many elements are impacted
- **Recommendation** — how to fix it

## Priority fixes

A curated list of the highest-impact issues to fix first, ranked by severity and potential improvement. This section pulls the most critical and warning-level issues to the top so you know exactly where to start.

## Sidebar navigation

A sticky sidebar shows all issue categories with their issue counts, letting you jump directly to any category without scrolling.

## Actions
