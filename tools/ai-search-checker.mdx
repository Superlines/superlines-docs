description: Analyze any webpage for AI search readiness across five key dimensions.
---

The AI Search Checker evaluates how well any webpage is optimized for visibility in AI-powered search results. It scores your page across five dimensions and provides prioritized recommendations to improve your AI search presence.

## What it analyzes

The tool evaluates five dimensions of AI search readiness:

| Dimension | What it checks |
|---|---|
| **SEO Metadata** | Title tags, meta descriptions, Open Graph tags, canonical URLs |
| **Structured Data** | Schema.org markup (JSON-LD, Microdata), rich result eligibility |
| **Semantic HTML5** | Proper use of headings, sections, landmarks, and semantic elements |
| **Content Quality** | Readability, depth, authority signals, E-E-A-T indicators |
| **LLM Readiness** | How well the content can be parsed and understood by AI models |

## How to use it

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter a URL">
    Navigate to **AI Search Checker** in the Tools section of the sidebar. Enter the URL of any webpage you want to analyze.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the analysis">
    Click **Analyze**. The tool will crawl the page and evaluate it across all five dimensions. This typically takes 10–30 seconds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review your scores">
    You'll see an overall AI Search Readiness Score (0–100) along with sub-scores for Technical, Content, and Schema dimensions, each with a brief rationale.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow the recommendations">
    Below the scores, you'll find prioritized recommendations ranked by impact. Each recommendation explains what to fix and why it matters for AI visibility.
  </Step>
</Steps>

| 40–59 | Needs Work | Significant gaps that limit AI visibility |
