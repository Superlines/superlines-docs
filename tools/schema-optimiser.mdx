title: Schema Optimiser
description: Analyze and optimize Schema.org structured data for any webpage to improve AI search visibility.
---

The Schema Optimiser analyzes any URL for existing Schema.org structured data and generates AI-optimized JSON-LD markup ready to paste into your page. Structured data helps AI models understand your content and increases the likelihood of being cited in AI responses.

## Why Schema.org matters for AI search

Schema.org structured data provides explicit signals to AI models about what your page contains — your product details, article metadata, organization information, FAQ content, and more. Pages with well-implemented schema markup are easier for AI models to parse, quote, and cite.

## How to use the Schema Optimiser

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter a URL">
    Navigate to **Schema Optimiser** in the Tools section. Enter the URL of the page you want to analyze.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the analysis">
    Click **Analyze Schema**. The tool detects and evaluates all structured data on the page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the results">
    You'll see a Schema Quality Score, detected schema types, and a detailed breakdown of what was found.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the optimized schema">
    The tool generates an improved JSON-LD version with AI-recommended changes. Copy it and add it to your page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Try the example sites (apple.com, shopify.com, bbc.com/news, stripe.com) to see how major sites implement schema and what the optimization process looks like.

## What the tool detects

The Schema Optimiser scans for structured data in multiple formats:

| Format | Description |
|---|---|
| **JSON-LD** | The recommended format — embedded in `<script>` tags |
| **Microdata** | Inline HTML attributes (itemscope, itemprop) |
| **Meta Tags** | Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and other meta-based markup |
| **Page Content** | Implicit data from headings, content structure, and page elements |
| **Rich Results** | Eligibility for Google rich results (FAQ, How-to, Product, etc.) |

## Understanding the quality score

The Schema Quality Score (0–100) reflects how well your structured data serves AI search visibility:

| Score | Rating | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| 80–100 | Good | Well-structured schema that supports AI discovery |
| 50–79 | Fair | Basic schema present but missing key properties |
| 0–49 | Needs Work | Minimal or no useful structured data |

The score accounts for completeness, accuracy, use of recommended properties, and alignment with AI search best practices.

## The optimization output

The tool provides:

- **Summary of changes** — how many nodes were added, enriched, or removed
- **AI-generated change list** — bullet-point explanation of each recommended change
- **Highlighted diff view** — visual comparison of your existing schema vs. the optimized version, making it easy to see exactly what changed
- **Detected schema types** — what types were found on the page (e.g., WebPage, Article, Product)
- **Page info** — title, meta description, and canonical URL of the analyzed page

## Implementing the optimized schema

You can copy the optimized JSON-LD in two formats:

1. **Raw JSON** — the JSON-LD object, useful if you manage schema through a CMS or build tool
2. **HTML script tag** — the complete `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag, ready to paste into your page's `<head>`

<Warning>
Always review the generated schema before implementing it. While the AI optimization is designed to be accurate, verify that the content matches your page and meets your requirements.
</Warning>
