## Main keyword card

The hero section shows detailed data for your researched keyword:

| Data point | Description |
|---|---|
| **Search Volume** | Monthly search volume for the keyword |
| **Traffic Potential** | Estimated traffic if ranking in position 1 |
| **CPC** | Average cost per click in paid search |
| **Search Intent** | Classification: informational, commercial, navigational, or transactional |
| **12-month Trend** | Area chart showing search volume over the past year |

## Quick stats

Four cards summarize the keyword landscape:

- **Similar Keywords** — count of closely related keywords
- **Related Keywords** — count of semantically related keywords
- **Question Keywords** — count of question-format variations
- **Total Keywords** — combined total found

## Keyword tabs

### Similar Keywords

Keywords closely matching your search term — variations, long-tail versions, and synonyms.

### Related Keywords

Semantically related keywords that share topical relevance but may use different phrasing.

### Question Keywords

Question-format keywords (how, what, why, where, when, which) — these are especially valuable for AI search because they mirror how users query AI models.

<Tip>
Question keywords are particularly valuable for AI visibility. AI models are designed to answer questions, so tracking and creating content for question-format prompts often yields the best results.
</Tip>

Each keyword tab shows a table with:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Keyword** | The keyword text |
| **Search Volume** | Monthly search volume |
| **CPC** | Cost per click |
| **Trend** | Sparkline showing 12-month search trend |
| **Intent** | Search intent classification |

Open the filter panel to narrow results:

- **Search Volume Range** — slider to set minimum and maximum volume
