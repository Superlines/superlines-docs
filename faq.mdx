## Reporting & data export

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How can I export the most comprehensive report?">
    There are several ways to get reports out of Superlines:

    **Quick options:**
    - Take a screenshot of the **Visibility** page at [analytics.superlines.io/dashboard](https://analytics.superlines.io/dashboard) or the **Overview** page
    - Use the **Export** button in the top-right corner of the Visibility page for a clean one-page summary

    **Advanced options:**
    - **REST API** — pull data into your own reporting system via the [Metrics API](/api/endpoints) and visualize it however you like
    - **MCP Server** — use Claude Desktop or Cursor to ask natural language questions about your data and generate custom reports ([setup guide](/mcp/setup))
    - **Looker Studio** — connect to Google Looker Studio for custom dashboards and scheduled reports ([integration guide](/integrations/looker-studio))
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are prompts defined during auditing?">
    When you create a brand, Superlines **automatically discovers relevant prompts** based on your industry, target audience, and competitors. These auto-generated prompts identify "hot" conversation topics that are relevant to your business — providing a great starting point for a lightweight AI search audit.

    You can then refine the list by adding your own high-priority questions, removing irrelevant ones, and organizing them with labels.

## Prompts & data

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do you know which prompts are relevant?">
    Superlines uses a multi-layered approach:

    1. **Industry analysis** — based on your business category and target audience
    2. **Competitor monitoring** — what topics competitors are being mentioned for
    3. **AI search trends** — tracking emerging queries in your space
    4. **Search data correlation** — mapping AI prompts to traditional search queries
    5. **User feedback** — learning from prompts you add, pause, or ignore

    The system continuously refines its suggestions as it learns what matters for your brand.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you know what people ask AI?">
    Our data comes from multiple sources:

    - **AI query databases** — aggregated, anonymized query data from AI platforms
    - **Search behavior analysis** — correlating traditional search queries with AI-era prompts
    - **Industry trend detection** — monitoring trending topics by vertical
    - **Platform observation** — analyzing public AI interactions and community forums

    <Note>
    We don't access individual user queries or private conversations. All data is aggregated and anonymized.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I buy more prompts or add more LLM engines later?">
    **Yes, absolutely.** You can upgrade your plan at any time to get:

    - More tracked prompts
    - Additional AI engines
    - More brands/domains
    - More team seats
    - API and MCP access

    Changes take effect immediately. Contact your account manager or upgrade directly in Organization Settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why don't you have historical data from before I signed up?">
    Superlines begins collecting data **from the moment you create a brand**. We can't provide historical data because:

    1. **Real-time testing** — we send your prompts to AI engines and capture actual responses, which requires active monitoring
    2. **AI responses change constantly** — unlike traditional search rankings, AI responses are dynamic and non-deterministic
    3. **No historical API** — AI platforms don't provide historical response data

    Your historical data **begins building from day one** and becomes more valuable over time as trends emerge.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do numbers change rapidly in the beginning?">
    This is normal behavior during the first 24–48 hours:

    - **Small sample sizes** make percentages volatile — one new response has an outsized impact
    - **Initial responses** are being collected across all engines simultaneously
    - Numbers **stabilize** within 48 hours as more responses are collected

    Wait at least 48 hours before drawing conclusions from your data.
  </Accordion>

## Metrics & definitions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Brand Visibility and Share of Voice?">
    These measure two different things:

    **Brand Visibility** = *"How often is my brand mentioned?"*
    ```
    Your brand mentions / Total AI responses × 100
    ```

    **Share of Voice** = *"How do I compare to competitors?"*
    ```
    Your brand mentions / All brand mentions (yours + competitors) × 100
    ```

    **Example:** If 100 prompts are tested:
    - Your brand appears in 30 responses → **Brand Visibility = 30%**
    - Total brand mentions across all responses: 200 (yours: 50, competitors: 150) → **SOV = 25%**

    Brand Visibility tells you about **your absolute presence**. Share of Voice tells you about **your competitive position**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is Average Position and how is it calculated?">
    **Average Position** measures where your brand typically appears in the order of brand mentions within AI-generated answers. Position 1 = mentioned first, Position 2 = mentioned second, etc.

    The average is **volume-weighted** — days with more AI responses have proportionally more influence on the score. This is similar to how Google Search Console calculates impression-weighted position.

    **Key points:**
    - Only responses where your brand is **actually mentioned** are included
    - Lower position = better (being mentioned first means AI models see you as a primary recommendation)
    - The **Average Position Ranking** leaderboard shows how you compare to all other brands

    **Example:** If an AI responds to "Best project management tools" and mentions Asana first, Monday.com second, and your brand third — your position for that response is 3.

    Average Position helps you understand the **quality** of your visibility. A brand can have high Brand Visibility (mentioned often) but poor Average Position (mentioned last). Improving your position means AI models treat your brand as a top recommendation.

## Account & billing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many brands can I create?">
    This depends on your plan:

    | Plan | Brands |
    |---|---|
    | Free | 1 |
    | Starter | Multiple |
    | Growth | Multiple |
    | Enterprise | Unlimited |

    Each brand is independent with its own prompts, competitors, and analytics. Prompts are shared across all brands from your organization quota.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need a cookie banner for the AI Bot Analytics?">
    **No.** Superlines does not use cookies or track website visitors. The platform works by:

    1. Sending your tracked prompts to AI engines
    2. Capturing and analyzing the responses
    3. Extracting brand mentions and citations

    This happens entirely **server-side** and doesn't involve your website visitors at all. No cookies, no tracking pixels, no GDPR consent required for the AI analytics functionality.
