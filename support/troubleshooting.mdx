## Data & Analysis

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My dashboard shows 'Analysis in Progress'">
    After adding or modifying prompts, Superlines needs time to collect and analyze responses from all AI engines. This process runs as part of the daily analysis cycle.

    **What to expect:**
    - New prompts typically start showing data within 24 hours
    - The analysis cycle runs daily — see [Analysis Process](/metrics/analysis-process) for timing details
    - Some engines may return data faster than others

    **If it persists beyond 48 hours:** Check that the prompt status is "Active" in [Prompt Management](/account/prompts). Paused prompts are not analyzed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My brand visibility shows 0% for some engines">
    Not all AI engines mention every brand for every prompt. A 0% visibility on a specific engine means that engine's responses didn't include your brand name for your tracked prompts during the selected period.

    **Steps to investigate:**
    - Check the [Mentions](/analytics/mentions) page with the specific engine filter to see actual response data
    - Review your [Brand Settings](/account/brands) to ensure your brand name and variations are correctly configured
    - Verify the date range — new prompts may not have enough historical data yet
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data looks different between pages">
    Different pages may show different numbers because of how filters and timeframes are applied:

    - **Date ranges** — ensure you're using the same date range across pages
    - **Engine filters** — each page may have different engines selected
    - **Prompt filters** — some pages focus on specific prompt subsets
    - **Metric calculations** — Brand Visibility (mentions/responses) and Share of Voice (your mentions/all mentions) use different denominators. See [Key Metrics](/metrics/key-metrics)

    Reset all filters and use the same date range to compare numbers across pages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Empty data on the dashboard">
    If you see empty states or "No data available":

    1. **New account** — allow 24 hours after onboarding for initial data collection
    2. **No tracked prompts** — add prompts via [Prompt Import](/account/prompt-import) or [Prompt Management](/account/prompts)
    3. **All prompts paused** — check for paused prompts and resume them
    4. **Date range** — you may have selected a period before your prompts were created
    5. **Filter conflict** — clear all filters and try again
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integrations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Google Analytics connection failed">
    If your GA4 connection isn't working:

    1. Ensure you've granted the correct permissions during the OAuth flow
    2. Verify you're connecting the right GA4 property (not Universal Analytics)
    3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting from the [Integrations](/integrations/google-analytics) page
    4. Ensure your GA4 property has data for the selected date range

    The AI Traffic page requires a configured GA4 property — see [GA4 AI Traffic](/website/ga4-ai-traffic) for setup steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Google Search Console not showing data">
    If GSC import returns no keywords:

    1. Verify your Search Console property is verified and has click/impression data
    2. Try a longer date range (28 or 90 days) — shorter ranges may have too few queries
    3. Ensure you've connected the correct property in [Integrations](/integrations/google-search-console)
    4. Some new properties may take time to accumulate search data
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slack notifications not arriving">
    If you're not receiving Slack notifications:

    1. Verify the Slack connection is active in [Integrations](/integrations/slack)
    2. Check your Slack channel — notifications go to the channel selected during setup
    3. Ensure the Superlines bot hasn't been removed from the channel
    4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the Slack integration
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Crawler tracking script not working">
    If bot traffic data isn't appearing:

    1. Verify the tracking script is installed correctly on your site — check for JavaScript errors in the browser console
    2. Allow 24 hours for initial data to appear
    3. Ensure the script is loaded on all pages you want to track
    4. For edge function setups, verify the function is deployed and active
    5. See [AI Crawler Analytics](/metrics/ai-crawler-analytics) for setup instructions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Prompts & Quotas

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I've reached my prompt quota">
    Each plan has a maximum number of tracked prompts. If you've reached the limit:

    1. **Remove inactive prompts** — pause or delete prompts that are no longer relevant
    2. **Upgrade your plan** — see [Subscription](/account/subscription) for plan options
    3. **Prioritize** — use [Prompt Strategy](/account/prompt-strategy) to focus on the highest-value prompts

    You can see your current usage on the [Prompt Import](/account/prompt-import) page quota bar.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Imported prompts aren't appearing">
    After importing prompts:

    1. Check the validation step — prompts may have been skipped during validation
    2. Verify import completed successfully (no error messages)
    3. Allow a few moments for prompts to sync — refresh the [Prompt Management](/account/prompts) page
    4. Check your quota — imports that exceed your limit may be partially processed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tools

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI Search Checker analysis is slow or fails">
    Page analysis typically takes 10–30 seconds. If it's taking longer or failing:

    1. Verify the URL is publicly accessible (not behind login or firewall)
    2. Check that the URL returns a valid HTML page (not a redirect loop or error page)
    3. Very large or complex pages may take longer to analyze
    4. Try again — temporary network issues can cause timeouts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Site Health analysis quota exceeded">
    Site health analyses are limited by your plan's monthly quota:

    1. Check your current usage on the [Site Health](/website/site-health) page
    2. Prioritize analyzing your most important pages
    3. The quota resets monthly
    4. Upgrade your plan for higher limits — see [Subscription](/account/subscription)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Account & Access

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Team member can't access certain features">
    Feature access is controlled by roles and domain permissions:

    1. Check the member's role in [Team & Roles](/account/team)
    2. Verify they have access to the relevant domain (domain-scoped roles only see their assigned domains)
    3. Some features require specific plan tiers — verify your [Subscription](/account/subscription) includes the feature
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't switch between brands/domains">
    If the domain switcher isn't working:

    1. Verify you have access to multiple domains in your organization
    2. Check your role permissions — some roles are scoped to specific domains
    3. Ensure the domain is active and not in a paused state
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
