The Visibility Dashboard is the most comprehensive analytics page in Superlines. It provides detailed views of your brand's AI search performance across four tabs — Overview, Prompts, Fan-Out Queries, and Latest Mentions.

## Overview tab

The default view with your core analytics:

### KPI cards

| Card | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Brand Visibility** | Radial metric showing mentions out of total responses, with trend |
| **Citation Rate** | Radial metric showing citations out of total responses, with trend |
| **Sentiment Score** | Breakdown of positive, neutral, and negative responses |
| **LLM Breakdown** | Brand visibility by individual AI engine |

### Trend charts

- **Brand Visibility Trend** — your visibility over time, with options to overlay competitor trends, toggle annotations, and compare to the previous period
- **Citation Rate Trend** — citation performance over time with annotations

### Average Position

Shows where your brand typically appears in AI responses:

- Average position metric with rank
- Position trend chart over time
- Competitor position comparison
- Position leaderboard table ranking all brands

<Info>
Average Position measures the order in which brands are mentioned. Position 1 means your brand is mentioned first — the most prominent placement. See [Key Metrics](/metrics/key-metrics) for the full definition.
</Info>

### Industry Ranking

A "Brands by Brand Visibility" table ranking all detected brands:

- Rank, brand name, mention count, change, and visibility percentage
- Toggle **Only my competitors** to filter the view
- Export as CSV or JSON

### Insight cards

Four quick-insight cards highlighting notable data points:

- **Top Prompt** — your highest-performing prompt
- **Top Competitor** — the competitor closest to your visibility
- **Top Query** — the highest-volume fan-out query related to your prompts
- **Priority Query** — a fan-out query with high potential but low current performance

### Additional sections

- **Visibility Rankings by Topic** — how your brand performs across content topics
- **Latest Brand Mentions** — recent AI response snippets mentioning your brand

## Prompts tab

A detailed table of all your tracked prompts with management capabilities:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Active, Paused, or Processing |
| **Prompt** | The tracked prompt text |
| **Brand Visibility** | Visibility percentage for this prompt |
| **Citation Rate** | Citation rate for this prompt |
| **Tests** | Number of times this prompt has been tested |
| **Mentions** | Brand mention count |
| **Labels** | Assigned prompt labels |

### Filters

- **Status** — All, Active, Paused, Processing
- **Labels** — multi-select label filter
- **Done status** — All, Done, Not done
- **Search** — text search across prompts

### Actions

- Edit prompt details
- Pause or resume testing
- Delete prompts
- Add new prompts via dialog
- Navigate to [Prompt Import](/account/prompt-import) or [Content](/content/overview)

## Queries tab

Shows fan-out queries — the LLM-generated search queries that AI models produce during conversations about your tracked prompts.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Query** | The LLM-generated search query |
| **Prompt** | Which tracked prompt triggered this query |
| **Citation Rate** | How often your site is cited for this query |
| **Search Volume** | Estimated search volume of the query |

<Tip>
Fan-out queries represent what AI models actually search for when answering user prompts. High-volume queries with low citation rates are your best content optimization targets.
</Tip>

## Mentions tab

A feed of the latest AI responses that mention your brand, showing actual response text, the AI engine, and when it was generated.

## Export Report

The dashboard includes a full report builder accessed via the **Export** button:

- Customizable sections (visibility, citations, rankings, competitors, sentiment, site health)
- White-label branding (logo, colors, company name)
- Shareable report URLs
- PDF download

See [Export & Reporting](/features/export-reporting) for full details.

## Response details

Click any prompt or mention to open a detailed view of individual AI responses:

- Full response text with formatted or original view
- Brand mention status
- Citation details and cited URLs
- All brands mentioned in the response
- Engine and model information

## Annotations

Add notes to trend charts to mark significant events (content launches, algorithm changes, competitor moves). Annotations appear as markers on the chart and are visible to your team.
