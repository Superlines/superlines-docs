Cross-Brand Analytics lets you compare performance across multiple brands or domains in your organization. This is especially valuable for agencies managing multiple clients and enterprises with multiple product lines or regional brands.

## Overview

Select any combination of your brands to see side-by-side performance data. The page aggregates metrics across all selected domains and provides comparative views for brand visibility, share of voice, citation rate, and more.

## Aggregated metrics

Six metric cards summarize performance across your selected domains:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Total Domains** | Number of domains selected for comparison |
| **Tracked Prompts** | Total prompts tracked across all selected domains |
| **Total Tests/Mentions** | Combined test count and mention volume |
| **Avg Brand Visibility** | Average brand visibility across selected domains |
| **Avg Share of Voice** | Average SOV across selected domains |
| **Avg Citation Rate** | Average citation rate across selected domains |

## Domain Performance Table

The main table compares each selected domain on key metrics:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Domain** | The brand/domain name |
| **Brand Visibility** | Percentage of AI responses mentioning this brand |
| **Share of Voice** | This brand's share of all brand mentions |
| **Citation Rate** | Percentage of responses citing this brand's URLs |
| **Total Mentions** | Absolute mention count |
| **Total Citations** | Absolute citation count |
| **Sentiment Score** | Overall sentiment of AI responses about this brand |

Click any row to open a detailed modal with per-prompt and per-engine breakdowns for that domain.

## Analytics sections

### Prompt Opportunities

Lists prompts where a domain has low brand visibility but high search volume — these represent the biggest opportunities for improvement. Each opportunity shows the prompt, current visibility, and potential impact.

### Top Cited Domains

Shows which domains (yours and others) are cited most across AI responses for your tracked prompts. This reveals the competitive landscape for citations.

### Trends

Charts showing brand visibility, share of voice, and citation rate trends over time for all selected domains. Overlay multiple domains to compare trajectory and identify divergence points.

### Top Prompts & Weak Prompts

- **Top Prompts** — prompts with the highest brand visibility across selected domains
- **Weak Prompts** — prompts with the lowest brand visibility, highlighting areas that need attention

### Brand Visibility by AI Engine

Breakdown of how each domain performs on different AI engines. This reveals engine-specific strengths and weaknesses — for example, one brand might perform well on ChatGPT but poorly on Perplexity.

### Performance by category

Additional breakdowns by:
- **Industries** — visibility by industry classification
- **Countries** — geographic performance differences
- **Target Groups** — performance by audience segment
- **Topics** — visibility across content topics

## Filters

- **Date range** — select the analysis period
- **Domain selector** — choose one or more brands to compare (multi-select)
- **LLM engines** — filter by specific AI engines
- **Advanced filters** — filter by country, language, industry, topic, business type, and target group

<Tip>
For agency teams: use Cross-Brand Analytics for monthly client reporting. Select each client's domain to generate a portfolio-level view, then drill into individual domains for client-specific insights.
