The Competitor Analysis page provides a dedicated view for benchmarking your brand against competitors in AI search. See who's winning on visibility, citations, and share of voice — and identify specific prompts where you can close the gap.

## KPI summary

Four cards at the top give you an instant competitive overview:

| **Competitors Tracked** | How many competitors are being monitored |
| **Top Competitor BV** | The competitor with the highest brand visibility |
| **Avg Competitor BV** | Average brand visibility across all tracked competitors |

## Brand Performance Overview

The main table ranks all brands (yours and competitors) by performance:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Rank** | Position based on overall brand visibility |
| **Brand** | Brand name with logo |
| **Top Fan-out Query** | The LLM-generated search query where this brand performs best |
| **Top Cited URL** | The URL most frequently cited for this brand |
| **Brand Visibility** | Percentage of AI responses mentioning this brand |
| **Total Mentions** | Absolute count of brand mentions |
| **Total Citations** | Number of times this brand's URLs were cited |

Click any row to open a detailed modal with deeper insights into that brand's performance by engine, prompt, and more.

## Charts and market share

## Competitor top-performing prompts

A table showing prompts where competitors outperform you:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Competitor** | Which competitor leads on this prompt |
| **Their Top Prompt** | The prompt text |
| **Their BV** | The competitor's brand visibility on this prompt |
| **Your BV** | Your brand visibility on the same prompt |
| **Gap** | The difference — your opportunity |

This is one of the most actionable sections. Prompts with a large gap represent specific topics where targeted content can improve your visibility.
