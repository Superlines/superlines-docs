title: Citations Analysis
description: Track which URLs are cited in AI responses and find opportunities to earn more citations.
---

The Citations Analysis page shows when and where AI models cite your website (and competitors') as a source. Citations are a strong signal of content authority — they mean an AI model considered your content authoritative enough to link to.

## Overview tab

### Citation Rankings

A ranked table showing how domains perform on citations:

- Domain rank by total citations
- Citation count and percentage share
- Change vs. previous period
- Filter between "My Domain", "Competitors", and "Industry" views

### Citations Gap

Identifies prompts where competitor URLs are cited but yours are not. Each gap shows:

- The prompt where you're missing citations
- Which competitor domains are being cited
- The specific URLs being cited
- The opportunity size

<Tip>
The Citations Gap is your roadmap for content optimization. Each entry shows a specific prompt where a competitor's URL is cited — study that URL to understand what makes it citation-worthy, then create or improve your own content to compete.

## UGC & Community tab

Identifies citation opportunities from user-generated content platforms where AI models frequently source information:

- **Reddit** — subreddit discussions being cited
- **Quora** — Q&A threads being cited
- **YouTube** — video content being cited
- Other community platforms

These opportunities highlight where participating in community discussions could lead to AI citations.
