description: Your daily starting point for monitoring AI search performance across all dimensions.
---

The Overview Dashboard is the first page you see after signing in. It provides a high-level snapshot of your brand's AI search performance across three key dimensions: brand visibility, citation rate, and crawler traffic.

## Dashboard tabs

The Overview is organized into three tabs, each focused on a different aspect of your AI search presence.

### Brand Visibility tab

The default view showing how often your brand is mentioned in AI responses.

**KPI cards at the top:**

| Card | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Top Prompt** | Your best-performing prompt and its brand visibility percentage |
| **Brand Visibility** | Your overall brand visibility with change vs. previous period |
| **Top Engine** | The AI engine where your brand performs best |
| **Top Label** | The prompt label category with highest visibility |

**Below the KPIs:**

- **Brand Visibility Trend** — a chart showing your visibility over time, with options to show a rolling average, competitor trends, and previous period comparison
- **Brand Leaders** — a ranked table of all brands mentioned in your tracked prompts, with mentions, change, and visibility percentage
- **Engine Performance** — visibility breakdown by AI engine
- **Prompts table** — all tracked prompts with their brand visibility, citation rate, total responses, and labels

### Citation Rate tab

Focused on how often AI responses link to your website.

**KPI cards:**

| Card | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Top Prompt** | Your best prompt by citation rate |
| **Citation Rate** | Overall citation rate with change vs. previous period |
| **Top Fan-Out Query** | The LLM-generated query driving the most citations |

**Below the KPIs:**

- **Citation Rate Trend** — chart showing your citation rate over time
- **Top Cited URLs** — which pages on your site are cited most
- **LLM Search Queries** — fan-out queries with their associated prompt, citation rate, and search volume
- **Prompts by Citation Rate** — all prompts ranked by citation performance

### Crawler Traffic tab

Shows how AI bots are crawling your website.

If you haven't installed the tracking script yet, this tab shows setup instructions with platform-specific guides for Webflow, WordPress, Shopify, Next.js, and edge function setups (Netlify, Vercel).

Once tracking is active, you'll see:

- **Bot Traffic Trend** — total crawler traffic over time, or broken down by individual bot
- **Top Bots** — which AI crawlers visit your site most
- **Top Crawled Pages** — which pages get the most bot traffic
- **Bot Categories** — breakdown of crawler types

<Info>
For a deeper analysis of crawler traffic with human vs. bot comparison and AI-specific bot tracking, see the dedicated [Crawler Analytics](/website/crawler-analytics) page.

## Filters

All tabs share a common set of filters:

- **Date range** — select the time period to analyze, with an option to include the current (incomplete) day
- **Engine** — filter by specific AI engines (multi-select)
- **Prompt** — focus on a specific tracked prompt
- **Label** — filter by prompt label categories

Filter selections are shown as chips above the content, making it easy to see what's active and clear individual filters.

## Using the Overview as a daily workflow

<Tip>
Start each day on the Overview Dashboard to quickly spot changes. Look for:

1. **Brand Visibility changes** — any significant drops or gains in the trend
2. **KPI shifts** — check if your top prompt, engine, or label has changed
3. **New leaders** — scan the Brand Leaders table for competitor movement
4. **Citation opportunities** — switch to the Citation Rate tab to find prompts with low citation rates

Then drill into specific analytics pages for deeper investigation.
