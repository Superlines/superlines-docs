Superlines tracks several core metrics to help you understand and optimize your brand's AI search visibility.

## Brand Visibility

**What it measures:** The percentage of AI responses that mention your brand.

```
Brand Visibility = (Responses mentioning your brand / Total responses) × 100
```

**Example:** If 100 prompts are tested and your brand appears in 30 responses, your Brand Visibility is **30%**.

| Benchmark | Rating |
|---|---|
| > 30% | Excellent |
| 20–30% | Good |
| 10–20% | Fair |
| < 10% | Needs improvement |

<Note>
Brand Visibility is the single most important metric — it tells you how visible your brand is when people ask AI about topics relevant to your business.

## Share of Voice (SOV)

**What it measures:** Your brand mentions as a percentage of **all brand mentions** (yours + competitors).

```
Share of Voice = (Your brand mentions / All brand mentions) × 100
```

**Example:** If there are 200 total brand mentions across all responses, and 50 are yours, your SOV is **25%**.

| Benchmark | Position |
|---|---|
| > 25% | Market leader |
| 15–25% | Strong presence |
| 5–15% | Moderate |
| < 5% | Needs attention |

### Key difference from Brand Visibility

- **Brand Visibility** = how often you're mentioned out of all responses
- **Share of Voice** = how often you're mentioned compared to competitors

SOV tells you about your competitive position. If your SOV is low but Brand Visibility is decent, it means competitors are also being mentioned frequently.

## Citation Rate

**What it measures:** The percentage of AI responses that cite (link to) your website.

```
Citation Rate = (Responses citing your website / Total responses) × 100
```

| Benchmark | Rating |
|---|---|
| > 20% | Excellent |
| 10–20% | Good |
| 5–10% | Fair |
| < 5% | Needs improvement |

<Tip>
Citations are a strong signal of content authority. AI models cite sources when your content is seen as authoritative and relevant. Focus on creating comprehensive, well-structured content to improve citations.

## Share of Citations

**What it measures:** Your website citations as a percentage of **all citations** in branded responses.

```
Share of Citations = (Your citations / Total citations in branded responses) × 100
```

This helps you understand how your website's authority compares to competitors in terms of being used as a source.

## Mentions

The raw count of times your brand is mentioned across all AI responses. While Brand Visibility is a percentage, Mentions gives you the absolute number — useful for understanding volume and trends.

## Sentiment Score

The average sentiment of AI responses that mention your brand:

- **Positive** — the AI presents your brand favorably
- **Neutral** — factual mention without strong sentiment
- **Negative** — the AI raises concerns about your brand

## Metrics by engine

All metrics can be filtered and broken down by AI engine. This helps you identify which engines your brand performs best on, spot engines where competitors are winning, and prioritize content strategies per platform.
