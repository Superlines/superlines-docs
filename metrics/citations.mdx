title: Citations & Fan-out Queries
description: Understand how AI engines cite your content and what searches they perform.

Citations and fan-out queries are two powerful concepts that help you understand how AI engines find and reference your content.

## What are citations?

A **citation** is a reference to a specific URL in an AI response. When an AI engine links to your website while answering a question, that's a citation.

### Why citations matter

- They're a **strong signal** of content authority
- They drive **referral traffic** from AI interfaces
- They indicate the AI considers your content **trustworthy and relevant**
- They're visible to the user as a credible source

### Which engines provide citations?

| Engine | Citations? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Copilot** | ✅ Yes | Frequently cites web sources |
| **Perplexity** | ✅ Yes | Always cites sources — citation-first model |
| **Google AI Overviews** | ✅ Yes | Cites sources in search results |
| **ChatGPT** (web) | Sometimes | Cites when web search is used |
| **Grok** | Sometimes | Cites from X/web when available |
| **Gemini** | Rarely | Mostly uses training data |
| **Claude** | Rarely | Primarily training data |
| **Mistral** | Rarely | Primarily training data |
| **DeepSeek** | Rarely | Primarily training data |

## Citation tracking in Superlines

Superlines tracks citations at two levels:

### Domain-level citations
See how often **your entire domain** (e.g., `superlines.io`) is cited across all responses. This shows overall domain authority.

### URL-level citations
See which **specific pages** on your site are cited most often. This helps you understand which content is performing best.

<Tip>
Focus on creating comprehensive, well-structured, authoritative content. AI engines cite content that directly answers the question with specific, useful information.

## What are fan-out queries?

When an AI engine with web access answers a question, it often performs **web searches** behind the scenes to find current information. These internal searches are called **fan-out queries**.

### Example

If a user asks: *"What are the best AI visibility tools?"*

The AI might perform these fan-out queries:
1. *"AI search visibility tools 2025"*
2. *"brand monitoring AI search"*
3. *"AI SEO tools comparison"*

### Why fan-out queries matter

- They reveal **what the AI searches for** when answering about your topic
- They show **where your domain ranks** in those searches
- They help you **optimize content** for AI retrieval specifically
- They expose **content gaps** — topics the AI searches for but you don't rank for

<Info>
Fan-out queries are one of the most powerful signals for competitive intelligence. For a full guide on using fan-out data to analyze competitors, identify content gaps, and build a content strategy, see [Competitive Intelligence](/metrics/competitive-intelligence).
