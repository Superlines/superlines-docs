title: Crawler Analytics
description: Track and analyze AI bot crawler traffic and human visitors to your website.
---

Crawler Analytics shows how AI bots and human visitors interact with your website. It goes beyond the conceptual coverage in [AI Crawler Analytics](/metrics/ai-crawler-analytics) with a full page walkthrough of the dashboard, its tabs, and how to use the data.

## Setup

To start tracking crawler traffic, install the Superlines tracking script on your website. The Crawler Traffic tab on the [Overview Dashboard](/analytics/overview-dashboard) provides setup instructions with platform-specific guides for:

- **Standard websites** — JavaScript snippet
- **Webflow, WordPress, Shopify, Next.js** — platform-specific instructions
- **Netlify, Vercel** — Edge Functions setup

<Info>
For detailed setup instructions, see the [AI Crawler Analytics](/metrics/ai-crawler-analytics) documentation.

## Crawlers tab

### KPI cards

| Card | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Top Crawler** | The most active bot visiting your site |
| **Top URL** | The page receiving the most bot traffic |
| **Top Category** | The most common bot category |
| **Top Country** | Where most bot traffic originates |

### Charts and tables

- **Bot Traffic Trend** — total bot traffic over time, or broken down by individual bot
- **Top Bots** — ranked table of bots with name, label, category, visit count, and percentage share
- **Top Crawled Pages** — which pages bots visit most, with both bot and human visit counts
- **Bot Categories** — pie chart and table showing the distribution of bot types
- **Bots by Country** — geographic distribution of crawler traffic

## Visitors tab

Human traffic analytics for comparison with bot activity:

### KPI cards

| Card | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Visitors** | Unique visitors (by IP) |
| **Pageviews** | Total page views |
| **Top Country** | Where most human traffic originates |
| **Top Referral** | Most common referral source |

### Charts and tables

- **Traffic Trend** — visitors and pageviews over time
- **Top Pages** — most visited pages
- **Top Referrers** — where your visitors come from
- **Visitors by Country** — geographic breakdown
- **Visitors by Device** — Mobile, Tablet, Desktop distribution
- **Visitors by Browser** — Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, etc.

## Human vs Bot tab

A direct comparison view showing:

- **Total Visits** — combined human and bot visits
- **Bot Visits** — absolute bot visit count
- **Human Visits** — absolute human visit count
- **Bot Percentage** and **Human Percentage** — relative shares
- **Human vs Bot Trend** — chart comparing traffic over time
- **Top Bots** — ranked list of most active bots

## AI Bot Data tab

Focused specifically on AI-related bot activity:

### Citation stats

Cards showing activity from specific AI bots:
- ChatGPT Citations
- Perplexity Bot activity
- Claude Bot activity
- Copilot activity

Each card includes a trend indicator showing whether activity is increasing or decreasing.

### AI-specific analytics

- **Top Pages** — pages most visited by AI bots
- **Citation Sources** — which AI services are citing your content
- **AI Bot Traffic Trend** — traffic split between training bots and search bots
- **AI Crawlers** — individual bot activity (OAI-SearchBot, GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, etc.)
- **Traffic Split** — visualization of training vs. search bot proportions

<Tip>
Pay special attention to the Training vs Search bot split. Search bots (like OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot) indicate your content is being used in real-time AI search results. Training bots (like GPTBot) indicate your content is being used for model training — both are valuable signals.
</Tip>

## Filters

Each tab has relevant filters:

- **Crawlers tab** — filter by Bot, Country, Page
- **Visitors tab** — filter by Page, Referrer, Device, Browser, Country
- **Human vs Bot tab** — filter by Bot, Country

## Exporting data

All tables support CSV and JSON export via the export dropdown.
