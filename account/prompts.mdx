**Prompts** are the questions people ask AI engines. Superlines tracks these prompts to measure your brand's visibility in responses.

## Adding prompts

There are several ways to add prompts to tracking:

### Auto-generated prompts
When you create a brand, Superlines automatically discovers relevant prompts based on your industry, target audience, and competitors. Review these suggestions and accept the ones that matter.

### Manual addition
1. Go to **Dashboard → Tracked Prompts**
2. Click **Add Prompt**
3. Enter the question (e.g., *"What is the best CRM for startups?"*)
4. Click **Create Prompt**

### Bulk import
Navigate to **Prompt Import** to:
- Upload a **CSV file** with prompts
- **Paste prompts** as text (comma or line-separated)
- Import from **Google Search Console** or **Reddit**

### Prompt opportunities
The **Dashboard** shows **Prompt Opportunities** — AI-discovered prompts relevant to your brand that you can add with one click. These are powered by [Prompt Radar](/account/prompt-radar), which automatically discovers trending prompts from SEO, SERP, and People Also Ask data sources.

### MCP-powered prompt management
You can also add and manage prompts programmatically via the [MCP server](/mcp/tools#add_prompts). This enables automated workflows where AI agents discover prompts from external data sources and add them to tracking. See [MCP Automation Workflows](/mcp/workflows#prompt-discovery) for examples.

<Info>
For a comprehensive guide on choosing the right prompts from multiple data sources — including marketing data, FAQ databases, keyword research, and automated discovery — see the [Prompt Strategy](/account/prompt-strategy) guide.

## Prompt statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ **Active** | Being tested regularly across AI engines |
| ⏳ **Processing** | Recently added, being queued for testing |
| ⏸️ **Paused** | Temporarily stopped — frees quota |
| 🚫 **Ignored** | Excluded from tracking |

<Tip>
**Pause** low-value prompts instead of deleting them. This frees quota while preserving historical data. You can resume anytime.
</Tip>

## Labels

Labels are tags you can assign to prompts for organization:

- Group prompts by **topic** or **campaign**
- Filter analytics by **priority** or **funnel stage**
- Track prompts for specific **product lines**

Labels can be **manually assigned** or **AI-generated** (Superlines can auto-label based on content analysis).

### Auto-labeling

Enable prompt automation in settings to:
- **Auto-add** suggested prompts from discovery
- **Auto-label** prompts based on content analysis
- **Auto-cleanup** duplicate or near-duplicate prompts

## Prompt quotas

Your organization has a **prompt quota** that's shared across all brands:

| Plan | Prompt quota |
|---|---|
| Free | 200 |
| Starter | Higher |
| Growth | Higher |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |

Prompts in **Active** or **Processing** status count toward your quota. **Paused** prompts do not.

<Note>
Check your current usage in **Organization Settings**. If you're near the limit, pause low-performing prompts or upgrade your plan.
</Note>

## Deleting prompts

Deleted prompts are permanently removed and free up quota immediately. Historical data is retained for reporting purposes.

To delete: select prompts in the table and use the bulk action menu, or delete individually from the prompt detail view.
