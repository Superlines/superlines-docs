title: Prompt Radar
description: Automatically discover trending prompts relevant to your brand from SEO and search data sources.
---

**Prompt Radar** analyzes SEO, SERP, and People Also Ask (PAA) data sources to automatically surface "hot" prompts that are relevant to your brand — but not yet in your tracking.

## What it does

Prompt Radar continuously scans external search data to identify high-potential prompts you should be monitoring. It bridges the gap between traditional search intelligence and AI search monitoring.

| Data source | What Prompt Radar extracts |
|---|---|
| **SERP analysis** | Questions and queries driving search results in your industry |
| **People Also Ask** | Related questions Google surfaces for topics relevant to your brand |
| **SEO keyword data** | High-volume search queries converted into conversational AI prompts |

<Info>
Prompt Radar finds prompts based on your brand's industry, target market, and existing prompt portfolio. The more context your brand has, the more relevant the discoveries.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Superlines analyzes your brand context">
    Based on your brand's industry, competitors, target audience, and existing tracked prompts, the system understands your market space.
  </Step>
  <Step title="External search data is scanned">
    SEO, SERP, and PAA data sources are analyzed to find trending or high-volume queries related to your space.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompts are scored and filtered">
    Discovered queries are converted into conversational prompts and scored for relevance to your brand. Duplicates and near-duplicates of your existing prompts are filtered out.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Opportunities are surfaced">
    Relevant prompts appear as **Prompt Opportunities** on your Dashboard, ready to add with one click.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing Prompt Radar suggestions

Prompt Radar suggestions appear in the **Dashboard** under the **Prompt Opportunities** section. Each suggestion includes:

- The prompt text
- The data source it was discovered from
- A relevance indicator
- A one-click action to add it to tracking

## When to use Prompt Radar

Prompt Radar is especially valuable when:

- **You're starting out** and need to build your prompt portfolio quickly
- **You don't have extensive internal data** (FAQ, support tickets, keyword lists) to draw from
- **You want to discover trends** — new topics emerging in your market that you haven't considered
- **You want continuous discovery** — markets evolve, and new questions emerge as AI search patterns change

<Tip>
Even if you have strong internal data, Prompt Radar catches market shifts you might miss. Use it as a complementary signal alongside your own data sources. See the [Prompt Strategy](/account/prompt-strategy) guide for how to combine multiple sources.

## Prompt Radar vs. other discovery methods

| Method | Best for | Effort | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prompt Radar** | Trending prompts, new topics, market shifts | Automatic | SERP, PAA, SEO data |
| **Google Search Console** | Queries already driving traffic to your site | Low (one-time integration) | Your existing search presence |
| **Bulk import from internal data** | Known customer questions, FAQ, support themes | Medium (data preparation) | Your existing knowledge base |
| **MCP-powered discovery** | Custom workflows, external data sources, automated pipelines | Higher (setup required) | Any data source you connect |
| **Manual addition** | Specific strategic prompts you've identified | Low per prompt | Your expertise |

## Best practices

| Practice | Why |
|---|---|
| **Review suggestions weekly** | New prompts surface as market data updates |
| **Add selectively** | Not every suggestion is strategic — focus on prompts aligned with your goals |
| **Label discovered prompts** | Tag Prompt Radar discoveries separately (e.g., `radar-discovery`) to measure their impact over time |
| **Combine with variations** | Enable [prompt variations](/account/prompt-variations) on radar-discovered prompts to test phrasing sensitivity |
| **Validate with volume data** | Cross-reference radar suggestions with keyword volume using the [keyword research tool](/mcp/tools#keyword_research) |
