## Domain-scoped access

For larger organizations, you can restrict a member's access to specific brands:

- **Full access** — member can see all brands in the organization
- **Scoped access** — member only sees selected brands

This is useful for agencies or enterprises where different teams manage different brands.

## Seat limits
