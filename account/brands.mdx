description: Configure your brands, market settings, and competitors.

A **Brand** (also called a **Domain**) represents a distinct business entity you want to monitor in AI search. Each brand has its own name, website, target market, competitors, tracked prompts, and analytics.

## What counts as a brand?

A brand can represent many things:

- **A product line** — "Nike Running", "Nike Basketball"
- **A geographic market** — "Acme UK", "Acme Germany"
- **A business unit** — "Retail Division", "Enterprise Division"
- **A sub-brand** — "Nike", "Jordan Brand", "Converse"
- **A specific campaign or landing page**

Each brand has independent analytics and configuration. Use the **domain switcher** in the sidebar to switch between brands.

## Creating a brand

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Brand Settings and click Add Brand" />
  <Step title="Enter basic information">
    - **Brand name** — the name you want to monitor (use the most common form customers use)
    - **Website URL** — your primary URL including `https://`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your market">
    - **Country** — your primary geographic market (affects prompt generation and analysis context)
    - **Language** — the language for monitoring (matches your content language)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define your audience (optional but recommended)">
    - **Target audience** — describe your ideal customer
    - **Industry / Topic** — your business category
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add competitors (up to 4 by default)">
    Enter each competitor's brand name and website. Choose direct competitors or market leaders to benchmark against.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Country and language matter.** They directly influence which prompts are generated, how responses are analyzed, and which competitors are relevant. Create separate brands for separate markets.
</Warning>

## Brand settings explained

### Brand name & variations

Superlines uses your brand name to detect mentions in AI responses. You can also configure:

- **Brand name variations** — alternative spellings or abbreviations (e.g., "Nike Run Club", "NRC")
- **Brand exclude list** — terms that should NOT count as brand mentions

### Competitor mappings

For each competitor, you can set up brand mappings to consolidate variations:

- **Canonical name** — the main name (e.g., "Nike Running")
- **Aliases** — variations (e.g., "Nike Run Club", "NRC")

This improves accuracy in Share of Voice and competitor analytics.

### Market configuration

| Setting | Purpose | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Country** | Geographic targeting | Affects prompt generation, competitor relevance, and analysis context |
| **Language** | Content language | Determines prompt language and response analysis |
| **Region** | Optional sub-region | Further refines geographic targeting |
| **Target audience** | Customer description | Improves AI-generated prompt suggestions |

## Automatic prompt generation

When you create a brand, Superlines **automatically discovers relevant prompts** based on:

- Your industry and business category
- Target audience definition
- Competitor analysis
- Current trending topics

<Tip>
The initial auto-generated prompts provide a great starting point. Review them and add your own high-priority questions as you learn more.

## Plan-based limits

| Resource | Limit |
|---|---|
| **Brands** | 1 on Free, multiple on paid plans |
| **Competitors per brand** | 4 (default, varies by plan) |
| **Prompts** | Shared quota across all brands |

## Best practices

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Single product/brand | 1 brand with core configuration |
| Multiple products | 1 brand per major product line |
| Multiple markets | 1 brand per country/language combination |
| Parent company + sub-brands | 1 brand per distinct brand identity |
