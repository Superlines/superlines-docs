title: Prompt Import
description: Import prompts from CSV files, text input, webpages, or Google Search Console.
---

The Prompt Import page provides multiple methods to add tracked prompts to your brand. You can upload a CSV file, paste text, extract prompts from webpages, or import keywords from Google Search Console.

## Prompt quota

At the top of the page, a quota bar shows your current prompt usage:

- **Current prompts** — how many tracked prompts you have
- **Maximum allowed** — your plan's prompt limit
- **Available** — remaining capacity

<Info>
If you're approaching your prompt limit, consider upgrading your plan or removing inactive prompts. See [Organizations](/account/organizations) for plan details.
</Info>

## Import options

Two shared options apply to all import methods:

- **Generate AI-enhanced prompts** — uses AI to expand and refine your input into optimized tracking prompts
- **Import as raw prompts** — imports your input exactly as entered, without AI enhancement

At least one option must be selected.

## Import methods

### CSV Upload

Upload a CSV file with your prompts. The expected format includes a `prompt` column and an optional `labels` column.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare your CSV">
    Create a CSV file with at least a `prompt` column. Add a `labels` column to pre-categorize prompts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the file">
    Click the upload area or drag and drop your CSV file. The file name and size will be shown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process">
    Click **Process CSV** to parse and validate your prompts before importing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Text Input

Paste or type prompts directly — one per line, or as comma-separated keywords.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter your prompts">
    Type or paste keywords and questions into the text area. The character count and detected prompt count are shown below.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process">
    Click **Process Text** to parse your input into individual prompts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Webpage URLs

Extract prompts from webpage content. The tool analyzes the page and identifies relevant questions and topics.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter URLs">
    Paste one or more webpage URLs into the text area (one per line).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure options">
    Toggle **Include branded prompts** to include brand-specific queries extracted from the pages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process">
    Click **Process Webpages** to analyze the pages and extract prompts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Google Search Console

Import real search queries from your GSC data — these represent actual questions people ask that lead to your site.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect GSC">
    If not already connected, click **Go to Integrations** to set up the Google Search Console connection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a date range">
    Choose how far back to fetch queries: 7 days, 14 days, 28 days, or 90 days.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import">
    Click **Import GSC Keywords** to fetch and process your search queries.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Google Search Console is one of the best sources for prompt discovery — these are real queries people type that already drive traffic to your site. Starting with a 28-day range gives a good balance of volume and relevance.
</Tip>

## Validation step

After processing any import method, you're taken to the validation page (`/prompt-import/validate`) where you can:

- Review all detected prompts before importing
- Edit individual prompts
- Remove prompts you don't want to track
- Confirm and create the prompts
