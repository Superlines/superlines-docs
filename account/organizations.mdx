An **Organization** is the top-level container in Superlines. It holds your subscription, team members, API keys, and platform-wide configuration.

## Organization settings

Navigate to **Organization Settings** in the sidebar to manage:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Organization name** | Display name used in reports, invitations, and billing |
| **Website** | Your organization's primary website URL |
| **Subscription plan** | Current plan (Free, Starter, Growth, Enterprise) |

## Subscription & usage

Your plan determines what's available across the entire organization:

| Resource | Free | Starter | Growth | Enterprise |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Brands (domains)** | 1 | Multiple | Multiple | Unlimited |
| **Tracked prompts** | 200 | Higher | Higher | Unlimited |
| **Countries** | 1 | Multiple | Multiple | Unlimited |
| **Languages** | 1 | Multiple | Multiple | Unlimited |
| **Team seats** | 3 | More | More | Unlimited |
| **AI engines** | 3 | 4+ | 6+ | All 9 |
| **API access** | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **MCP server** | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Usage is **aggregated** across all brands. For example, if Brand A uses 100 prompts and Brand B uses 50, your organization total is 150 prompts.

<Tip>
Monitor your usage in Organization Settings. If you're approaching limits, consider pausing unused prompts or upgrading your plan.

    A new key is created with the format `sl_live_...`
