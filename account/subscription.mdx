The Subscription page shows your current plan, usage across key dimensions, and the features and AI engines available on your plan.

## Current plan

The top of the page displays your active plan details:

- **Plan name** — Free, Starter, Growth, or Enterprise
- **Billing cycle** — monthly or yearly
- **Status** — active, trial, or cancelled
- **Next billing date** — when your next payment is due
- **Cancellation date** — shown if the plan is set to cancel

## Available plans

Browse all available plans with their features and pricing. Each plan card shows:

- Plan name and description
- Key features included
- Pricing (monthly and yearly options)
- Call-to-action to upgrade or switch

<Info>
Yearly billing typically offers a discount compared to monthly billing. You can switch between billing cycles from the subscription management portal.

## Usage monitoring

Track your current usage against plan limits:

| Resource | What it tracks |
|---|---|
| **User Seats** | Team members in your organization |
| **Tracked Prompts** | Active prompts across all domains |
| **Enabled LLM Engines** | AI engines activated for monitoring |
| **Article Generations** | Monthly content generation quota |
| **Crawled URLs** | Pages monitored for site health (org-wide) |

Each resource shows a progress bar indicating current usage vs. your plan limit. Warnings appear when you're approaching or exceeding limits.

<Warning>
When you exceed a usage limit, related features may be restricted. For example, exceeding your tracked prompt limit prevents adding new prompts until you remove existing ones or upgrade.
</Warning>

## Features by plan

The Features section shows which capabilities are available on your current plan:

- Report Builder
- Industry Data
- Cross-Brand Analytics
- CSV Export
- And other plan-specific features

Features not available on your current plan are shown as locked, with an indication of which plan includes them.

## LLM engines

View all available AI engines and which ones are currently enabled for your organization. The number of engines you can enable depends on your plan tier.
