Superlines provides multiple ways to export data and generate reports — from quick CSV downloads on individual tables to comprehensive branded PDF reports covering all your analytics.

## Export formats

| Format | Where available | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **CSV** | Most data tables | Importing into spreadsheets, custom analysis |
| **JSON** | Most data tables | Programmatic use, API workflows |
| **PDF** | Dashboard Export Report | Stakeholder reports, executive summaries |
| **PNG** | Charts | Presentations, social media |
| **Markdown** | AI Search Checker, Articles | Documentation, sharing analysis |

## Table exports

Most data tables across the platform have an export dropdown. Click the export icon on any table to download data as CSV or JSON. Available on:

- Overview Dashboard tables (Brand Leaders, Prompts, Top Cited URLs, LLM Queries)
- Competitor Analysis (Brand Performance table)
- Mentions / Response Data
- Citations Data
- Crawler Analytics (all tables)
- Keyword Research (keyword tables)
- Cross-Brand Analytics (Domain Performance table)

## Dashboard Export Report

The Visibility Dashboard includes a full report builder that generates comprehensive PDF reports.

### Creating a report

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Export modal">
    On the Visibility Dashboard, click the **Export** button in the page header.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose report sections">
    Select which sections to include in your report:
    - Brand visibility metrics and trends
    - Citation rates
    - Industry rankings
    - Platform performance by AI engine
    - Competitor share of voice
    - Query performance
    - Sentiment analysis
    - Site health (optional)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure branding">
    Customize the report with white-label branding:
    - Upload your logo
    - Set brand colors
    - Add your company name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate the report">
    Click generate to create your PDF report. Once ready, you can download it or share it via a unique URL.

Use the shareable report URL for client reporting — it provides a professional, branded view of performance data without requiring platform access.

## API-based exports

For programmatic access, several dedicated export endpoints are available:
