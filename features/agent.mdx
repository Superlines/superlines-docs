The AI Agent is a conversational assistant built into Superlines that lets you ask natural-language questions about your brand's AI search performance, run technical audits, analyze competitors, and generate strategic action plans — all from a single chat interface.

## What the Agent can do

The Agent has access to your brand data and a suite of built-in tools:

| Capability | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Query your data** | "What's my brand visibility trend this month?", "Which prompts have the highest citation rate?" |
| **Competitor intelligence** | "Who's getting cited more than me?", "Analyze competitor X's homepage" |
| **Run audits** | "Audit my homepage for AI search readiness", "Check my schema markup" |
| **Generate action plans** | "Create a strategic action plan to improve my visibility", "What should I prioritize?" |
| **Content guidance** | "What topics should I write about?", "How can I improve my FAQ page for AI?" |

When you open the Agent, you'll see pre-built suggestion cards to help you get started:

- **"Who's getting cited?"** — Discover which domains AI models cite most for your tracked prompts
- **"Strategic action plan"** — Get a prioritized list of actions to improve your AI visibility
- **"Audit my homepage"** — Run a full AI search readiness analysis on your website
- **"Analyze a competitor"** — Deep-dive into a competitor's AI search presence

## Example prompts

Here are effective prompts to try:

- *"Show me my brand visibility trends for the last 30 days across all engines"*
- *"Which of my tracked prompts have the lowest citation rate?"*
- *"Audit https://example.com for AI search readiness"*
- *"Compare my brand sentiment to my top 3 competitors"*
- *"What schema markup should I add to my product pages?"*
- *"Generate a weekly action plan based on my current metrics"*

## How it connects to your data

The Agent works with the same data you see across the platform:

- **Tracked prompts** — queries your prompt portfolio and performance metrics
- **Responses & mentions** — accesses AI response data across all monitored engines
- **Citations** — analyzes which URLs are being cited and where
- **Competitors** — compares your performance against configured competitors
- **Site health** — can trigger and review technical audits of your pages

<Info>
The Agent uses the same tool set as the [MCP Server](/mcp/overview). If you're already familiar with MCP tools, the Agent provides the same capabilities through a visual chat interface.

## Limitations

- The Agent works with data available in your Superlines account — it cannot access external data beyond what the built-in tools provide
- Audit and analysis tools require a URL input and are subject to your plan's usage limits
- Complex multi-step analyses may take a few moments to complete

## Actions from the Agent

When the Agent generates recommendations, these can appear as actionable items in the [Action Center](/features/action-center). This creates a workflow where insights from the Agent become trackable tasks.
