The Action Center is where AI-generated insights become actionable tasks. It collects recommendations from the AI Agent's analysis and organizes them into categories you can work through, complete, or dismiss.

## How actions are generated

Actions are created when the [AI Agent](/features/agent) analyzes your data and identifies opportunities for improvement. The Agent examines your brand visibility, citations, content, and technical SEO to produce specific, actionable recommendations.

Each action includes:

- A **description** of what to do
- A **category** indicating the type of work
- A **priority** level (high, medium, or low)
- A **relevant URL** linking to the tool or page where you can take action

## Action categories

| Category | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **New Content** | Topics and pages you should create to improve AI visibility |
| **Content Optimization** | Existing content that needs improvement for better AI performance |
| **Technical Optimization** | Technical SEO issues affecting your AI search presence |
| **Schema Optimization** | Structured data improvements to help AI understand your pages |
| **Community Discussion** | Opportunities on platforms like Reddit, Quora, or forums |
| **Media Outreach** | PR and media opportunities to boost brand authority |

## Managing actions

### Status workflow

Each action has one of three statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Pending** | Not yet addressed — waiting for your attention |
| **Completed** | You've taken action and marked it as done |
| **Dismissed** | You've reviewed it and decided not to act on it |

### Working with actions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review pending actions">
    Open the Action Center from the sidebar. Pending actions are shown by default, with a count badge indicating how many await your attention.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter by category">
    Use the category buttons to focus on a specific type of action. Each category shows a count of pending items.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take action">
    Click on an action to navigate to the relevant tool or page. For example, a Schema Optimization action might link to the [Schema Optimiser](/tools/schema-optimiser).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update the status">
    Mark the action as **Completed** when you've addressed it, or **Dismissed** if it's not relevant. You can always filter to see completed or dismissed actions later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Filtering and navigation

- **Status filters** — toggle between All, Pending, Completed, and Dismissed
- **Category filters** — focus on specific action types (each shows its count)
- **Refresh** — reload the action list to see newly generated recommendations

<Tip>
Use the Action Center as a weekly workflow: review new pending actions, prioritize by category, and work through them systematically. This creates a consistent optimization loop between your analytics insights and concrete improvements.
