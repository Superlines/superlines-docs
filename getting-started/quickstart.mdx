This guide walks you through the essential steps to start monitoring your brand's AI search visibility.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign up at [superlines.io](https://superlines.io) and verify your email. You'll be guided through the onboarding flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your organization">
    Enter your organization name and website. This creates the top-level container for all your brands, team members, and subscription.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first brand">
    During onboarding, configure your first brand:
    - **Brand name** — the name you want to monitor (e.g. "Superlines")
    - **Website** — your primary URL
    - **Country & language** — your target market
    - **Competitors** — up to 4 direct competitors
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate your prompts">
    Superlines automatically discovers relevant prompts for your brand. Review the suggested prompts and add any custom ones. These are the questions your audience asks AI — like *"What is the best AI visibility tool?"*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for initial data">
    Your first analytics appear within **24–48 hours** as Superlines tests your prompts across multiple AI engines.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite your team">
    Go to **Team Management** and invite colleagues:
    - **Admin** — full platform access (no billing)
    - **Member** — read-only analytics access
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Start with 20–50 core prompts and gradually expand based on what you learn. Quality over quantity.
</Tip>

## What to check first

Once data starts flowing, head to the **Dashboard** to see:

- **Brand Visibility** — what % of AI responses mention your brand
- **Share of Voice** — your brand mentions vs. all competitors
- **Citation Rate** — how often your website is cited in responses
- **Prompt Performance** — how each tracked prompt performs
