description: How different teams and companies use Superlines to improve their AI search visibility.
---

Superlines serves a wide range of teams — from enterprise brand organizations managing multi-channel visibility to performance-focused marketers optimizing for AI-driven traffic. Here's how different customer types get the most out of the platform.

## Enterprise brand monitoring

**Best for:** Companies with existing marketing data, brand guidelines, and multiple stakeholders across brand, insights, comms, content, and PR teams.

### The challenge

Large organizations already have rich data about their market: marketing messages, FAQ databases, support ticket themes, keyword research, and competitive intelligence. The challenge is understanding how this existing knowledge translates to AI search visibility — and coordinating across teams to improve it.

### How they use Superlines

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import existing data as prompts">
    Use your existing assets as the foundation for AI search monitoring:

    | Data source | Example prompts |
    |---|---|
    | **Marketing messages** | Core value propositions rephrased as questions |
    | **FAQ databases** | Customer questions you already answer on your site |
    | **Support tickets** | Common issues and questions from real customers |
    | **Keyword research** | High-volume search queries converted to conversational prompts |
    | **Competitive intelligence** | Questions where competitors are strong |

    Import via [bulk upload](/account/prompts#bulk-import), [Google Search Console](/integrations/google-search-console), or the [MCP server](/mcp/overview).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Organize with labels and brands">
    Structure prompts by team, campaign, product line, or funnel stage using [labels](/account/prompts#labels). Create [separate brands](/account/brands) for different markets or business units.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track brand visibility across teams">
    Share dashboards across teams. Each team focuses on different metrics:

    | Team | Primary focus |
    |---|---|
    | **Brand / Comms** | Brand Visibility, Sentiment Score, Share of Voice |
    | **Content / SEO** | Citations, Fan-out Queries, Content Opportunities |
    | **PR** | Sentiment trends, competitor mention analysis |
    | **Insights** | Week-over-week trends, engine-level breakdowns |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Act on competitive intelligence">
    Use [fan-out query analysis](/metrics/competitive-intelligence) to discover what content drives AI citations for competitors — and create better content for those topics.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Enable [prompt variations](/account/prompt-variations) to test how different phrasings of the same question affect your brand visibility. This is especially valuable for large brands monitoring messaging consistency.
</Tip>

## Performance-focused AI visibility

**Best for:** Marketing teams and SEO professionals who want to capture traffic from AI search by appearing in high-volume, high-intent prompts.

### The challenge

Smaller teams may not have extensive existing data. They need to discover which prompts have real market volume and then systematically improve their visibility on those prompts — similar to how traditional SEO targets high-value keywords.

### How they use Superlines

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover high-value prompts automatically">
    Start with Superlines' auto-generated prompts, then expand using:

    - **[Prompt Radar](/account/prompt-radar)** — automatically discovers trending prompts from SEO, SERP, and People Also Ask data sources
    - **[Google Search Console](/integrations/google-search-console)** — imports real queries where you already have impressions or clicks
    - **[MCP-powered discovery](/mcp/workflows#prompt-discovery)** — use AI agents to scrape trends and add prompts programmatically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Focus on strategic prompts">
    Identify prompts where you must beat competitors. Label these as strategic and monitor them closely. Use [competitive gap analysis](/metrics/competitive-intelligence#competitive-gap-analysis) to prioritize.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize content for fan-out queries">
    When AI engines answer a prompt, they search the web behind the scenes. [Fan-out queries](/metrics/citations#what-are-fan-out-queries) reveal exactly what they search for. Optimize your content to rank for these specific queries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automate the content pipeline">
    Use the [MCP server](/mcp/workflows) to build automated workflows:
    1. Identify prompts where you have low visibility
    2. Analyze what top-cited pages do well
    3. Feed insights to a content agent
    4. Publish optimized content
    5. Monitor improvement in Superlines
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agency & multi-brand management

**Best for:** Agencies managing AI search visibility for multiple clients, or companies with multiple brands and markets.

### How they use Superlines

- **Separate brands per client** — each with its own prompts, competitors, and analytics
- **Label-based organization** — group prompts by campaign, product, or priority across clients
- **API and MCP integration** — automate reporting and monitoring across all clients
- **Team roles** — give clients read-only access to their brand data while maintaining admin control
