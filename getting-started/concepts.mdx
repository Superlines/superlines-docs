Before diving into the platform, it helps to understand the key concepts that Superlines is built around.

## Account hierarchy

Superlines uses a hierarchical structure:

```
Organization
├── Brand (Domain) 1
│   ├── Prompts + Labels
│   ├── Competitors
│   └── Analytics
├── Brand (Domain) 2
│   ├── Prompts + Labels
│   ├── Competitors
│   └── Analytics
└── Team Members (org-wide)
```

- **Organization** — your top-level account. It holds your subscription, team members, API keys, and LLM engine configuration.
- **Brand (Domain)** — a business entity you want to monitor. Each brand has its own name, website, target market, competitors, prompts, and analytics.
- **Prompts** — the questions people ask AI. Superlines tracks how each prompt performs across AI engines.
- **Labels** — tags for organizing prompts by topic, campaign, priority, or any custom category.

## What are prompts?

A **prompt** is a question or query that people type into AI assistants. Examples:

- *"What are the best project management tools for remote teams?"*
- *"How do I improve my website's AI search visibility?"*
- *"Which CRM is best for small businesses?"*

Superlines **tracks** these prompts by testing them across multiple AI engines (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) and recording:
- Whether your brand is mentioned in the response
- Whether your website is cited as a source
- Which competitors appear
- The overall sentiment

## What are responses?

A **response** is an AI engine's answer to a tracked prompt. Each time Superlines tests a prompt, it captures the full response and analyzes it for:

- **Brand mentions** — does the response name your brand?
- **Website citations** — does the response link to or reference your domain?
- **Competitor mentions** — which other brands appear?
- **Sentiment** — is the mention positive, neutral, or negative?

## What are citations?

A **citation** is a reference to a specific URL in an AI response. When an AI model links to your website (or a competitor's), that's a citation. Citations are a strong signal of content authority.

<Note>
Not all AI engines provide citations. Models with web access (like Perplexity, Copilot, Google AI Overviews) cite sources more often than offline models.
</Note>

## What are fan-out queries?

When an AI model with web access answers a question, it often performs **web searches** behind the scenes. These internal searches are called **fan-out queries**. Superlines tracks these to show you:

- What search terms the AI uses when answering about your topic
- Where your domain ranks for those searches
- Opportunities to improve your content for AI retrieval
