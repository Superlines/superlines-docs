title: MCP Server Overview
description: Connect AI assistants like Claude and Cursor to your Superlines analytics data.
---

The **Superlines MCP Server** implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) — an open standard that lets AI assistants interact with external tools and data sources.

This means you can **ask questions about your AI search visibility data in natural language** directly from Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, or any MCP-compatible client.
